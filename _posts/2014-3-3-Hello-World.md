title: Bais Variance Tradeoff
published: true
---
Machine Learning is all about creating the models ,But when we try create models we encounter many errors and one of the most important error in machine learning which is called **Bais Variance Tradeoff**

Bais Variance Tradeoff can be broke down into three part :
- Bais
- variance
- irreducible error

These are the three errors often happend when we try to create a model
Let's understand what these  errors are and how we can control it

## What Is Bais error ?

Bais error occur when we make simplifying assumption.
In this picture above the points are scattered in the 2D plane between size and price in the first image we have created a simple plan to seprate the points
